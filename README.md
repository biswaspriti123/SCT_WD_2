📌 Project Title: 🕒 Stopwatch Web Application

  Live Demo : https://biswaspriti123.github.io/SCT_WD_2/


✅ Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a responsive, interactive stopwatch web app that allows users to start, stop, and reset time with a clean and attractive user interface.



🛠️ Technologies Used


HTML – For structuring the web page.

CSS – For styling and layout.

JavaScript – For implementing stopwatch functionality (timer logic, buttons, interaction).


⚙️ Features:


🟢 Start Button: Starts the stopwatch from 00:00:00.

⏸️ Stop Button: Pauses the stopwatch at the current time.

🔁 Reset Button: Resets the time to 00:00:00.

⏱️ Live Updating Time: Displays minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

📱 Responsive Design: Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

🎨 Modern UI: Clean layout with styled buttons and timer.


💡 How It Works:
When the Start button is clicked, setInterval is triggered to count time.

Stop button pauses the interval using clearInterval.

Reset sets the timer back to zero and updates the display.

Timer displays the formatted time (minutes:seconds:milliseconds).
